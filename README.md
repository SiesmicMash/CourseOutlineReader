Student Grade Calculator

This project aims to create a program that helps students predict their final grades and CGPA based on test results and expected grades. It is designed to read course outlines and generate predicted grades based on both completed and upcoming assignments or exams.

Objective:

The goal of this project is to assist students in calculating how much they need to score on future tests or exams to achieve a desired final grade, particularly when the final distribution of grades isn't immediately clear. This project was inspired by my experience as a university student, where understanding how much I need to score on a final exam can be challenging.

Features:

    Grade Average Calculator: Calculates the average grade for a series of tests.
    Student Class: Stores subject grades for each student and calculates CGPA.
    Course Outline Reader (Future Development): Reads course outlines to determine weightages for different tests, assignments, and exams, and generates a predicted grade based on input.
    Future Grade Predictor (Future Development): Allows students to input their expected grades for incomplete assessments to calculate their predicted final grade.

How It Works:

    Input the grades for the tests you have completed.
    Provide any expected grades for future assignments or tests.
    The program will calculate your predicted final grade and CGPA based on your inputs and course outline.

Motivation:

This is my first personal project, so while the code may not be the most optimized, it addresses a problem that I, and many other students, often face. At the end of a semester, professors provide grades in a way that makes it difficult to figure out how much you need to score on the final exam to achieve a desired grade. This project seeks to make that process simpler and more transparent.
Future Development

    Course Outline Integration: Automatically read data from course outlines (weightages, assignment types) to streamline the grade prediction process.
    Improved UI: Adding a more user-friendly interface for inputting grades and expected outcomes.

How to Use:

    Clone this repository.
    Compile the C++ files using a C++ compiler.
    Follow the prompts to input your course data and grades.
